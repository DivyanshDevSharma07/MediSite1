            <h2>Welcome to Surgical Website</h2>
            <p>As a general rule, a procedure is considered surgical when it involves cutting of a person's tissues 
                or closure of a previously sustained wound. Other procedures that do not necessarily fall under this 
                rubric, such as angioplasty or endoscopy, may be considered surgery if they involve "common" surgical 
                procedure or settings, such as use of antiseptic measures and sterile fields, sedation/anesthesia, 
                proactive hemostasis, typical surgical instruments, suturing or stapling. All forms of surgery are 
                considered invasive procedures; the so-called "noninvasive surgery" ought to be more appropriately 
                called minimally invasive procedures, which usually refers to a procedure that utilize natural orifices 
                (e.g. most urological procedures) or does not penetrate the structure being excised 
                (e.g. endoscopic polyp excision, rubber band ligation, laser eye surgery) or to a radiosurgical procedure 
                (e.g. irradiation of a tumor).[citation needed]<br>

                <h2>Types of surgery</h2><br>
                Surgical procedures are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, the degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation.
                <ul>
                    <h3>Based on timing:[citation needed]</h3><br>
                    <li>Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the person's 
                        convenience, or to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability.</li><br>
                    <li>Semi-elective surgery is one that is better done early to avoid complications or potential deterioration 
                        of the patient's condition, but such risk are sufficiently low that the procedure can be postponed for a 
                        short period time.</li><br>
                    <li>Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done without any delay to prevent death or serious disabilities 
                        and/or loss of limbs and functions.</li><br>
                    <h3>Based on purpose:[citation needed]</h3><br>
                    <li>Exploratory surgery is performed to establish or aid a diagnosis.</li><br>
                    <li>Therapeutic surgery is performed to treat a previously diagnosed condition.</li><br>
                    <li>Curative surgery is a therapeutic procedure done to permanently remove a pathology.</li><br>
                    <li>Cosmetic surgery is done to subjectively improve the appearance of an otherwise normal structure.</li><br>
                    <li>Bariatric surgery is done to assist weight loss when dietary and pharmaceutical methods alone have failed.</li> <br>         
                    <h3>By type of procedure:</h3>
                    <li>Amputation involves removing an entire body part, usually a limb or digit; castration is the amputation of testes; 
                        circumcision is the removal of prepuce from the penis or clitoris (see female circumcision). Replantation involves 
                        reattaching a severed body part.</li><br>
                    <li>Resection is the removal of all or part of an internal organ and/or connective tissue. A segmental resection specifically 
                        removes an independent vascular region of an organ such as a hepatic segment, a bronchopulmonary segment or a renal lobe.
                        Excision is the resection of only part of an organ, tissue or other body part (e.g. skin) without discriminating specific vascular territories. 
                        Exenteration is the complete removal of all organs and soft tissue content (especially lymphoid tissues) within a body cavity.</li><br>
                    <li>Extirpation is the complete excision or surgical destruction of a body part.</li><br>
                    <li>Ablation is destruction of tissue through the use of energy-transmitting devices such as electrocautery/fulguration, laser, 
                        focused ultrasound or freezing.</li><br>
                    <li>Repair involves the direct closure or restoration of an injured, mutilated or deformed organ or body part, usually by suturing or internal fixation. 
                        Reconstruction is an extensive repair of a complex body part (such as joints), often with some degrees of structural/functional 
                        replacement and commonly involves grafting and/or use of implants.</li><br>
                    <li>Grafting is the relocation and establishment of a tissue from one part of the body to another. A flap is the relocation of a 
                        tissue without complete separation of its original attachment, and a free flap is a completely detached flap that carries an 
                        intact neurovascular structure ready for grafting onto a new location.</li><br>
                    <li>Bypass involves the relocation/grafting of a tubular structure onto another in order to reroute the content flow of that target structure from a specific segment directly to a more distal ("downstream") segment.
                    <li>Implantation is insertion of artificial medical devices to replace or augment existing tissue.</li><br>
                    <li>Transplantation is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from a different human 
                        (or animal) into the person undergoing surgery. Harvesting is the resection of an organ or body part from a 
                        live human or animal (known as the donor) for transplantation into another patient (known as the recipient).</li><br>
                    <h3>By organ system: Surgical specialties are traditionally and academically categorized by the organ, organ system or body region involved. Examples include:</h3><br></li><br>
                    <li>Cardiac surgery — the heart and mediastinal great vessels;</li><br>
                    <li>Thoracic surgery — the thoracic cavity including the lungs;</li><br>
                    <li>Gastrointestinal surgery — the digestive tract and its accessory organs;</li><br>
                    <li>Vascular surgery — the extra-mediastinal great vessels and peripheral circulatory system;</li><br>
                    <li>Urological surgery — the genitourinary system;</li><br>
                    <li>ENT surgery — ear, nose and throat, also known as head and neck surgery when including the neck region;</li><br>
                    <li>Oral and maxillofacial surgery — the oral cavity, jaws, and face;</li><br>
                    <li>Neurosurgery — the central nervous system, and;</li><br>
                    <li>Orthopedic surgery — the musculoskeletal system.</li><br>
                    <h3>By degree of invasiveness of surgical procedures:</h3><br>
                    <li>Conventional open surgery (such as a laparotomy) requires a large incision to access the area of interest, and 
                        directly exposes the internal body cavity to the outside.</li><br>
                    <li>Minimally-invasive surgery involves much smaller surface incisions or even natural orifices 
                        (nostril, mouth, anus or urethra) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, 
                        as in laparoscopic surgery or angioplasty.</li><br>
                    <h3>By equipment used:</h3>
                    <li>Laser surgery involves use of laser ablation to divide tissue instead of a scalpel, scissors or similar 
                        sharp-edged instruments.
                    <li>Cryosurgery uses low-temperature cryoablation to freeze and destroy a target tissue.</li><br>
                    <li>Electrosurgery involves use of electrocautery to cut and coagulate tissue.</li><br>
                    <li>Microsurgery involves the use of an operating microscope for the surgeon to see and manipulate small structures.</li><br>
                    <li>Endoscopic surgery uses optical instruments to relay the image from inside an enclosed body cavity to the outside, 
                        and the surgeon performs the procedure using specialized handheld instruments inserted through trocars placed 
                        through the body wall. Most modern endoscopic procedures are video-assisted, meaning the images are viewed on 
                        a display screen rather than through the eyepiece on the endoscope.</li><br>
                    <li>Robotic surgery makes use of robotics such as the Da Vinci or the ZEUS robotic surgical systems, to remotely 
                        control manipulators under stereotactic endoscopy.</li><br>
                    </li><br>
