            <h2>Welcome to Homopathic History</h2>
            <p>Homeopathy was created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann. Hahnemann rejected the mainstream medicine of the late
                18th century as irrational and inadvisable because it was largely ineffective and often harmful.
                He advocated the use of single drugs at lower doses and promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of how
                living organisms function. The term homeopathy was coined by Hahnemann and first appeared in print in 1807.
                He also coined the expression "allopathic medicine", which was used to pejoratively refer to traditional
                Western medicine.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Homeopathy or homoeopathy is a pseudoscientific system of alternative medicine. It was conceived in
                        1796 by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann. Its practitioners, called homeopaths or homeopathic
                        physicians, believe that a substance that causes symptoms of a disease in healthy people can cure
                        similar symptoms in sick people; this doctrine is called similia similibus curentur, or "like cures
                        like". Homeopathic preparations are termed remedies and are made using homeopathic dilution. In
                        this process, the selected substance is repeatedly diluted until the final product is chemically
                        indistinguishable from the diluent. Often not even a single molecule of the original substance
                        can be expected to remain in the product. Between each dilution homeopaths may hit and/or shake
                        the product, claiming this makes the diluent "remember" the original substance after its removal.
                        Practitioners claim that such preparations, upon oral intake, can treat or cure disease.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>All relevant scientific knowledge about physics, chemistry, biochemistry and biology contradicts
                        homeopathy. Homeopathic remedies are typically biochemically inert and have no effect on any known
                        disease. Its theory of disease, centered around principles Hahnemann termed miasms, is inconsistent
                        with subsequent identification of viruses and bacteria as causes of disease. Clinical trials have
                        been conducted and generally demonstrated no objective effect from homeopathic preparations. The
                        fundamental implausibility of homeopathy as well as a lack of demonstrable effectiveness has led
                        to it being characterized within the scientific and medical communities as quackery and fraud.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. It was introduced to the United
                        States in 1825, and the first American homeopathic school opened in 1835. Throughout the 19th
                        century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States. During
                        this period, homeopathy was able to appear relatively successful, as other forms of treatment
                        could be harmful and ineffective. By the end of the century, the practice began to wane, with
                        the last exclusively homeopathic medical school in the United States closing in 1920. During
                        the 1970s, homeopathy made a significant comeback, with sales of some homeopathic products
                        increasing tenfold. The trend corresponded with the rise of the New Age movement and may be
                        in part due to chemophobia, an irrational aversion to synthetic chemicals, and the longer
                        consultation times homeopathic practitioners provided.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>In the 21st century, a series of meta-analyses have shown that the therapeutic claims of
                        homeopathy lack scientific justification. As a result, national and international bodies
                        have recommended the withdrawal of government funding for homeopathy in healthcare. National
                        bodies from Australia, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and France, as well as the European
                        Academies' Science Advisory Council and the Russian Academy of Sciences have all concluded
                        that homeopathy is ineffective and recommended against the practice receiving any further
                        funding. The National Health Service in England no longer provides funding for homeopathic
                        remedies and asked the Department of Health to add homeopathic remedies to the list of
                        forbidden prescription items. France removed funding in 2021, while Spain has also announced
                        moves to ban homeopathy and other pseudotherapies from health centers.</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
                <b>Note:- They are two different alternatives to modern medicine. While Homeopathy focuses on curing an ailment,
                    Ayurveda focuses on disease prevention. Homoeopathic medicines are derived from plant, animal and synthetic
                    sources, which are diluted using alcohol or distilled water.</b><br>
