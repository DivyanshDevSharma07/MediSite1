            <h2>Health Scheme</h2>
            <p>Newspapers often carry headlines like:<br>
                -Get 5 lakh health insurance by Government,Government health insurance for senior citizens.<br>
                -Prime Minister health insurance scheme 2018 (or specifically, Modi health insurance scheme 2018).<br>
                -And a lot more varying from one Indian state to another. Such headlines are about Government health insurance schemes.<br>
                -A Government Health Insurance Scheme is a State or Central Government powered health insurance initiative for its citizens.
                It is directed towards enhancing the healthcare quotient of the region by offering low-priced insurance policies with a 
                sizeable sum insured. Such policies are usually offered on an annual basis.<br>

                <p>Government health schemes are initiatives implemented by governments to provide healthcare services and financial 
                    protection to their citizens. These schemes aim to improve access to quality healthcare, especially for vulnerable 
                    and marginalized populations. Here are some key points about government health schemes:
                </p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li><b>Universal Healthcare Access:</b>Many government health schemes aspire to achieve universal healthcare access, ensuring that all 
                        citizens have the right to essential health services without facing financial hardship.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Financial Protection:</b>These schemes often include components that offer financial protection to individuals and families, 
                        helping them avoid catastrophic healthcare expenses. This is typically achieved through subsidies, insurance coverage, or direct 
                        financial assistance.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Targeted Programs:</b>Some government health schemes are designed to address specific health issues or target particular 
                        demographic groups. Examples include maternal and child health programs, vaccination campaigns, and disease-specific initiatives.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Preventive Healthcare:</b>Emphasis is often placed on preventive healthcare measures to reduce the incidence of diseases. This may include 
                        vaccination programs, health education, and screening services.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Public-Private Partnerships:</b>Governments may collaborate with private healthcare providers to enhance the reach and 
                        effectiveness of health schemes. Public-private partnerships can improve service delivery and infrastructure.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Technology Integration:</b>Many modern government health schemes leverage technology to enhance healthcare delivery and 
                        management. This includes the use of electronic health records, telemedicine, and mobile health applications.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Community Engagement:</b> Successful health schemes involve communities in planning and implementation. Community engagement fosters awareness, 
                        encourages participation, and ensures that healthcare services are culturally sensitive and relevant.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>Regular Evaluation and Adjustments:</b>Governments routinely evaluate the effectiveness of health schemes to identify areas for 
                        improvement. This may involve adjusting policies, reallocating resources, or expanding the scope of programs based on evolving 
                        health needs.
