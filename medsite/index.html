                <p><h2>What Is Ayurvedic Medicine?</h2><br>
                    The ancient Indian medical system, also known as Ayurveda, is based on ancient writings that rely on a “natural” and holistic approach to physical and mental health.
                    Ayurvedic medicine is one of the world's oldest medical systems and remains one of India’s traditional health care systems. Ayurvedic treatment combines products 
                    (mainly derived from plants, but may also include animal, metal, and mineral), diet, exercise, and lifestyle.

                    <br>
                    Homeopathy is a holistic system of alternative medicine founded by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century.
                    The central principle of homeopathy is "like cures like," which means that a substance that causes symptoms 
                    in a healthy person can be used in a highly diluted form to treat similar symptoms in a sick person.It's 
                    essential to note that while some people report positive experiences with homeopathy, scientific evidence 
                    supporting its efficacy is often limited and inconclusive. <br>

                    "Surgical" refers to anything related to surgery. Surgery is a medical specialty that involves 
                    the use of invasive procedures to treat diseases, injuries, or conditions through manual or 
                    instrumental techniques. Surgeons are medical professionals who specialize in performing 
                    surgical procedures.<br>
                    Surgical procedures may involve the use of instruments, such as scalpels, forceps, and sutures,
                    to access and treat specific areas of the body. Surgeries can be categorized into various types.
