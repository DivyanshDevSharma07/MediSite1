                <ul>
                    <li>Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, is an archaic and derogatory label originally used 
                        by 19th-century homeopaths to describe heroic medicine, the precursor of modern 
                        evidence-based medicine.There are regional variations in usage of the term. 
                        In the United States, the term is sometimes used to contrast with osteopathic medicine, 
                        especially in the field of medical education. In India, the term is used to distinguish 
                        conventional modern medicine from Siddha medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, Unani and other 
                        alternative and traditional medicine traditions, especially when comparing treatments and 
                        drugs.</li><br>
                    <li>A study released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001 defined allopathic medicine 
                        as "the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, 
                        biomedicine, evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine.The WHO used the term in a 
                        global study in order to differentiate Western medicine from traditional and alternative 
                        medicine, noting that in certain areas of the world "the legal standing of practitioners is
                        equivalent to that of allopathic medicine" where practitioners can be separately certified in 
                        complementary/alternative medicine and Western medicine.</li><br>
                        <br><h2>History</h2><br>
                    <li>The practice of medicine in both Europe and North America during the early 19th century is 
                        sometimes referred to as heroic medicine because of the extreme measures (such as bloodletting) 
                        sometimes employed in an effort to treat diseases.The term allopath was used by Hahnemann and 
                        other early homeopaths to highlight the difference they perceived between homeopathy and the 
                        "conventional" heroic medicine of their time. With the term allopathy (meaning "other than the 
                        disease"), Hahnemann intended to point out how physicians with conventional training employed 
                        therapeutic approaches that, in his view, merely treated symptoms and failed to address the 
                        disharmony produced by underlying disease.[clarification needed] Homeopaths saw such symptomatic 
                        treatments as "opposites treating opposites" and believed these methods were harmful to patients.<br>

                        Practitioners of alternative medicine have used the term "allopathic medicine" to refer to the 
                        practice of conventional medicine in both Europe and the United States since the 19th century. 
                        In that century, the term allopath was used most often as a derogatory name for the practitioners 
                        of heroic medicine,a precursor to modern medicine that itself did not rely on evidence of 
                        effectiveness.<br>
